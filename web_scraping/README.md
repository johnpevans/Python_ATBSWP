Exercises are from Al Sweigart's book/class *[Automate the Boring Stuff with
Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)*.

in the exercise located under *soup.py* I was Getting a 503 error when using
the Amazon site. Through the Udemy FAQ forum it was suggested the use of
headers to make it seem as though the request was coming from a browser.
I was then having trouble with retrieving results. The instructor stated that
this was because of Amazon, which was true. So I used another suggestion for
a different site.

For the *selenium_python.py* file, a copy of the file for chromedrive.exe was
included because it was necessary in order to utilize the webdriver function.
